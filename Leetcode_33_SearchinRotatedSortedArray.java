 * 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1

        int low = 0, high = nums.length - 1;
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;

            int num = nums[mid];
            if ((nums[mid] < nums[0]) != (target < nums[0]))
                num = target < nums[0] ? Integer.MIN_VALUE : Integer.MAX_VALUE;

            if (num < target) low = mid + 1;
            else if (num > target) high = mid - 1;
            else return mid;
        }
        return -1;
    }
